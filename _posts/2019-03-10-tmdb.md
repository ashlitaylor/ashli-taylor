### Background
The Movie Database [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows. Since 2008, TMDb has been improved and expanded upon by it's community of dedicated fans. I used TMDb API to explore Drama movies from 2004 and create a similarity network and database of the most popular titles.

This project is comprised of the following sections:
1) Python Code that accesses the TMDb API to scrape and parse data for 350 movies that have been released in the 'Drama' genre since 2004 and five movies that are similar.
	* I used this data to create a similarity graph using Gephi. 
2) SQL script to create tables and pull the highest scoring movies and actors. 

### Python Code - Scrapping & Cleaning
###### API and Account set up
An API key is needed to access the TMDb data and run the Python code. 
* How to get a [TMDb account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup)
* Request an [API key](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQkWjHiLS1Xu2HZNQ7Egv08l_DdPnugoxUOZ0ugqBNHWY529xWB417QoSS0MbIih6PS9gu1Y1D-NFDT/pub)
* TMDb API [Documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

##### Importing the necessary modules and libraries
I imported the following libraries:
* http.client to open the API query links
* json to load the URLs for the query pages
* csv to export the data 
* urlib to 
* defaultdict 
```python
import http.client
import json
#import time
import sys
#import collections
import urllib
import urllib.request
from urllib.request import urlopen
import csv
from collections import defaultdict
import threading
import urllib.parse
```

###### Drama Query
The code below takes the user's unique API key as the input for when the query is made.

```python
API_KEY = input()
```

I first created an empty dictionary to store the raw query data, and an empty list to store the list of pages of the query. 


```python
drama_genre_query = {}
drama_list_pages = list()
```

I used the API to search for movies in the ‘Drama’ genre released in the year 2004 or later. I retrieved the 350 most popular movies in this genre and sorted them from most popular to least popular. Multiple API calls are needed to retrieve all movies. Each query returns one page that contains 20 data instances, so I use a 'for' loop to request the first 18 pages that contains data for the top 18 x 20 = 360 movie titles. 


```python
q1b_url = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=' + API_KEY + '&language=en-US&sort_by=popularity.desc&include_adult=false&include_video=false&primary_release_date.gte=2004-01-01&with_genres=18'
pages = list(range(1,19))
for i in pages:
    page_url_append = '&page=' + str(i)
    drama_page = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(q1b_url+page_url_append))
    drama_results = drama_page['results']
    drama_list_pages.append(drama_results)
```

I created a dictionary containing movie-ID and title key:value pairs with top 350 movies and saved the data to a csv file. Each line in the file describes one movie in the following format: 
```
movie-ID,movie-name 
```

```python
for page in range(0, (len(drama_list_pages))):
    for movie in range(0, (len(drama_list_pages[page]))):
        movie_id = drama_list_pages[page][movie]['id']
        movie_name = drama_list_pages[page][movie]['title']
        if len(drama_genre_query) < 350:
            drama_genre_query.update({movie_id: movie_name})
#Writing movies to CSV file
csv_file = 'movie_ID_name.csv'
with open(csv_file, 'w', encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)    
    writer.writerows(drama_genre_query.items()) 
```

###### Similar movie retrieval
For each movie that I retrieved, I used the API to find its 5 similar movies. The API will return as many as it can find, so I made my code code flexible to work with however many movies the API returned. I looped through each movie title that I collected with my first API call to use a function to obtain the similar movies. The API allows 40 requests every 10 seconds, so I built a timeout interval into my code while looping through the requests.

```python
urlfront = 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/'
urlend = '/similar?api_key=' + API_KEY + '&language=en-US&page=1'
similar_movie_list = list()

def similarrequest(queryurl):
    similar_movie_query = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(queryurl))
    similar_movies = similar_movie_query['results']
    if len(similar_movies) > 5:
        similar_movies = similar_movies[0:5]
    for target in range(0, len(similar_movies)):
        target_movie_id = similar_movies[target]['id']
        similar_pair = source, target_movie_id
        similar_movie_list.append(similar_pair)    

for source in drama_genre_query:
    queryurl = urlfront + str(source) + urlend
    requesttimer = threading.Timer(0.25, similarrequest(queryurl))
    requesttimer.start()    
    requesttimer.cancel()
```

###### Deduplication
After I found all similar movies, I removed all duplicate movie pairs. That is, if both the pairs A,B and B,A are present, I only keep A,B where A < B. I saved the results in a csv file, where each line in the file describes one pair of similar movies in format movie-ID,similar-movie-ID


```python
paircount = defaultdict(int)
test_list = similar_movie_list.copy()
for source, target in test_list:
    pair = (min(source, target), max(source, target))
    paircount[pair] += 1
    #print(list(paircount.keys()))
paircount = defaultdict(int)
update_list = similar_movie_list.copy()
for source, target in update_list:
    pair = (min(source, target), max(source, target))
    paircount[pair] += 1
for source, target in paircount:
    pair = source, target
    if(paircount[pair]) >= 2:
        pair_remove = target, source
        update_list.remove(pair_remove)
similar_dict = dict(update_list)

#Writing to CSV file
csv_file = 'movie_ID_sim_movie.csv'
with open(csv_file, 'w', encoding="utf-8") as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerows(similar_dict.items())
```

##### Similar movie network graph

After I pulled the movie-ID:similar-movie-ID pairs, I used [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) to create the graph below that maps the movie similarity. I chose to color and scale the nodes based on the number of in-degree connections

### SQLite - Database Tables

I used SQLite to create two tables named ‘movies’ and ‘movie_cast’ with columns having the indicated data types:

<strong>movies</strong>

| Column | Data Type |
|--------|-----------|
| id     | integer   |
| name   | text      |
| score  | integer   |

<strong>movie_cast</strong>

| Column    | Data Type |
|-----------|-----------|
| movie_id  | integer   |
| cast_id   | integer   |
| cast_name | text      |

I imported the provided movie-name-score.txt file into the movies table, and movie-cast.txt into the movie_cast table. I only used absolute/local paths for these database tasks. 

###### Calcualting a proportion
I found the proportion of movies having a score > 50. 

###### Highest Scoring movies
I list the seven best movies (highest scores) sorted by score from highest to lowest, then by name in alphabetical order in the below format.

|      id   |      name |   score   |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|


###### Most Prolific actors
I list the five cast members with the highest number of movie appearances (movie_count).The number of appearances is sorted from highest to lowes. In the case of a tie in the number of appearances, I sort the results of cast_name in alphabetical order in the below format. 

| cast_id   | cast_name |movie_count|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|

###### High Scoring Actors
I list the top ten cast members who have the highest average movie scores. The output is sorted by average score (from high to low). In the case of a tie, the results are sorted by cast_name in alphabetical order. Movies that have a score less than 50 are not included. Additionally, cast members who have appeared in two or fewer movies are excluded.
