<h3> <u><br>Background</u> </h3>
</header>

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009. It was created by a developer who used the pseudonym  a pseudonymous developer, Satoshi Nakamoto, who designed the original bitcoin protocol in 2008 and launched the network in 2009. 

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to facilitate instant payments. Payments can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs. When a user sends bitcoins, the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin being sent to that address in an output. Since transactions can have multiple outputs, users can send bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction. These transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and are recorded in a public distributed ledger. Despite not having a status as legal tender, Bitcoin is the earliest cryptocurrency to achieve widepsread popularity and success, and has triggered the launch of several other virtual currencies. The value of one bitcoin has increased from virtually nothing after it's inception in 2009, to over $20,000USD at it's peak in 2017. With the increase in popularity of Bitcoin and other cyptocurrencies, it is important to maintain__. 

Due to the p2p nature of OTC transactions, users are exposed to counterparty risk. To mitigate this risk, users need to have access to their counterparty's reputation and trade history.  This is precisely the kind of information that the OTC web of trust provides. The OTC network merely aggregates data that is available, and does not act as an intervening body for bitcoin transactions. As such, it is each individual's responsibility to conduct due diligence on their counterparties, and otherwise act in a prudent way to avoid falling prey to fraudulent users. The [Bitcoin OTC Marketplace]("https://www.bitcoin-otc.com/") is an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace for trading with bitcoin that offers a web of trust service. I analyzed this Bitcoin OTC network using the [DataFrame API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.Dataset) in Spark and Scala on the Databricks platform. Before running this code, create an [account](https://databricks.com/try-databricks) on Databricks. Only a community account is necessary.

<h3> <u>The Scala Code</u> </h3>
</header>

I imported various Apache Spark functions for this project.

* sql.functions._ :
* spark.implicits :
* edges : 

```scala
//Importing Apache Spark Functions
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.desc
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._
case class edges(Source: String, Target: String, Weight: Int)
import spark.implicits._
```

<h3> <u>The Data</u> </h3>
</header>

The [Bitcoin OTC trust weighted signed network](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-sign-bitcoin-otc.html) is a who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using the platform, and maintains a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. It is comprised of almost 6,000 nodes and over 35,000 edges. 

<table styles = "width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th colspan = "2"><strong>Dataset Statistics</strong></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nodes</td>
    <td>5,881</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Edges</td>
    <td>35,592</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Edge Weight Range</td>
    <td>-10 to +10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Percentage of positive Edges</td>
    <td>89%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Each line has one rating, sorted by time, with the following format:

```
SOURCE, TARGET, RATING, TIME
```
where
* SOURCE: node id of source
* TARGET: node id of target
* RATING: the source's rating for the target, ranging from -10 to +10 in steps of 1
* TIME: the time of the rating, measured as seconds since Epoch

I created a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) from the bitcoinotc.csv file and convert it to a dataframe. I only need to use the source, target and rating to store the network data.
