  content: "I was first introduced to 'big data' working as an engineer at a 24/7
    semiconductor fabrication facility, and have been honing my skills on how to explore
    it, visualize it, and build a narrative with it ever since. Some of my fields
    of study and interest include Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Deterministic
    Optimization, Bayesian Statistics, and Cloud Computing technologies. I have developed
    a fluency in R, Python, SQL, Pig, and Scala, and use Tableau and D3.JS to share
    the insights that I gain from my data exploration. Check out my website or get
    in touch to see more of what I have learned \U0001F469\U0001F3FE‚Äç\U0001F4BB"
