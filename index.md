  content: 'I was first introduced to ''big data'' working as an engineer at a 24/7
    semiconductor fabrication facility, and have been honing my skills on how to explore
    it, visualize it, and build a narrative with it ever since. Some of my fields
    of study and interest include Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Deterministic
    Optimization, Financial modelling, and Cloud Computing technologies. I have developed
    fluency in R, Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and I use Tableau and D3.JS to share
    the insights that I gain from my data exploration. I currently work as a Data
    Scientist at a technical consulting company where I use my affinity for data exploration
    and analytics to develop actionable and scalable solutions for our clients. Check
    out my website or get in touch to see more of what I have learned. '
