I got my professional start in 2014 working as a process engineer at a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. The equipment I managed was in production on a 24-7-365 basis and could generate over 600 lines of data per product, with thousands of products being processed per day. I used this large volume of data to make business decisions that drove our wafer quality, throughput, and line capacity. I was familiar with the term 'Big Data' as a dynamic challenge in technology and one of our decade's most popular buzzwords, but it was not until I got my professional start that I recognized it's magnitude and it's role in solving today's problems. It was in this fast paced, high throughput environment that I discovered my affinity for data analytics and visualization tools, and why I chose to pursue a career in data science. 

Since 2014 I have been honing my skills on how to wrangle data, visualize it, derive statistical insights, and build compelling narratives to address issues in a diverse range of fields. I furthered my professional and academic development by obtaining a Masters degree in Analytics from [The Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/about/rankings) with a degree concentration in [analytical tools](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/analytical-tools-track). Through this degree concentration I have gained a skill set in quantitative methodology and have fluencies in R, Python, SQL, Pig, and Scala. I have applied these languages in a variety of applications, including:

  display:inline;
}

The aspect of data science that motivated me to pursue a Masters degree is the diversity of applications where it can be used to have an impact. Through my academic pursuits, I have enjoyed creating projects that explore a variety of domains ranging from health care, to market analysis, to consumer analytics.

My professional and academic development helped me gain an invigorating perspective on my career goals and the expansive potential of data analytics, and is the driving force behind my focus on a career in Data Science.
