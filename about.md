My professional career started in 2014 as a Process Engineer at a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. I was familiar with the term 'Big Data' as a dynamic challenge in technology and one of our decade's most popular buzzwords, but it was not until my position as a Process Engineer that I recognized it's magnitude and it's role in solving today's problems. The equipment I managed was in production on a 24-7-365 basis, and could generate over 600 lines of data per product, with thousands of products being processed every day. I used this large volume of data to make business decisions that drove our wafer quality, throughput, and line capacity. It was in this fast paced, high throughput environment that I discovered my affinity for data analytics and visualization tools, and why I chose to pursue a career in data science. 

Since 2014 I have been honing my skills on how to wrangle data, visualize it, derive statistical insights, and build compelling narratives to address issues in a diverse range of fields. My professional and academic development has been furthered by obtaining a Masters degree in Analytics from [The Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/about/rankings) with a concentration in [analytical tools](https://www.analytics.gatech.edu/curriculum/analytical-tools-track). This degree concentration provided a well-rounded curriculum that fostered my skill set in quantitative methodology, and I have developed fluencies in R, Python, SQL, Pig, and Scala. A few of my areas of application include:

One of the aspects of data science that motivated me to pursue a Masters degree is the diversity of applications where it can be used to have an impact. Through my academic pursuits, I have enjoyed creating projects that explore a variety of domains ranging from health care, to market analysis, to consumer analytics.

My professional and academic development helped me gain an invigorating perspective on my career goals and the expansive potential of data analytics, and is the driving force behind my focus on a career in Data Science.
